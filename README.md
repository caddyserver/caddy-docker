## Release instructions (for maintainers)

The release process is currently semi-automated, held together with shell scripts and gomplate (and duct tape).

1. update the `stackbrew-config.yaml` file (update `caddy_version`) and save
2. run `make` (note that you'll need [`gomplate`](https://docs.gomplate.ca/installing/) on your path)
3. commit all changed Dockerfiles and `stackbrew-config.yaml` and issue a PR
4. once the CI passes and the PR is merged, pull and run `make all` - this should update the `library/caddy` file
5. commit the updated `library/caddy` file and push directly to `master`
6. Finally, issue a PR for [`docker-library/official-images/library/caddy`](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/caddy) containing the updated `library/caddy` file
